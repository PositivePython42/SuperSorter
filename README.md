# SuperSorter
SupaSorter, written by Sean Massey, contact sean@positivepython.co.uk
Built on Python 3.9
Runs 10 different sorting engines in 2 modes.
1. A single pass of all the algorithms, using a sample of the users choice, shows timings and a bar chart
2. Multi-passes of all algorithms, creating a data frame of the data and a plot showing time degredation of all sorts.
